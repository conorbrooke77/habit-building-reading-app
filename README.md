# BookByte - Habit-Building-Reading-App
An Android app for my Final Year Project designed to enhance daily reading habits. Users can upload reading materials and the app divides them into digestible chunks. Have tailor reading segments, track progress, and stay motivated with streaks and notifications. BookByte promotes habit-building, offering a new approach to reading.
